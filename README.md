# Speech Enhancement for Hearing Aids Using a Combination of Binaural and Periodicity Features

This is the MATLAB code of the speech enhancement algorithm developed during my master thesis at Universit√§t Oldenburg in 2022.

To try it out, simply clone or download the repository, and run the *thomsen2022_main.m* script.

Notes:
- You must add the folder of the repository and all its subfolders to your MATLAB search path.
- You need to install the [SOFA API for Matlab/Octave](https://sourceforge.net/projects/sofacoustics/).

The main function of the speech enhancement algorithm is *01_base/speechEnhancement.m*. Its subfunctions are stored in the folders *03_filterbank*, *04_periodicityAnalysis*, *05_directionOfArrivalEstimation* and *06_enhancementStage*.

The folder *02_testSignalGeneration* contains a few test stimuli and functions used by *thomsen2022_main.m* for generating binaural multi-talker test signals.

The folder *Hohmann2002* contains the original implementation of the gammatone filterbank that is used by the *subbandDecomposition.m* and *subbandResynthesis.m* functions. It is taken from the [Auditory Modeling Toolbox](https://sourceforge.net/projects/amtoolbox/).

*testSuite.m* and *TestAlgorithm.m* contain unit tests that were used during the development of the algorithm.
